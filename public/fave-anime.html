<h1>The Best Animes According to Phouthone</h1>
<h2>My top 3 animes of all time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Grave of the Fireflies</h3>
<p>My first anime I fell in love with. A little depressing and made me cry.</p>

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>This is my favourite anime. I love the beautiful images.</p>

<h3>My Neighbor Totoro</h3>
<p>Love this one because it reminds me of my girls. They would watch it everyday.</p>
